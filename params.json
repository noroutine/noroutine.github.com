{"name":"Noroutine Pages","tagline":"my very own hq","body":"Content here was boring, so I decided to remove it.\r\n\r\nMy name is Alex, I live in Berlin and mostly try to have fun, or I just imagine it... Overall my life goal is to conquer this planet and live the rest of my life in eternal joy and happiness. \r\n\r\nI've made some nice tools, like [dust4j](http://dust4j.noroutine.me/) and [Tobacco](http://tobacco.noroutine.me/) - pretty useful stuff I think... \r\n\r\nWhen I feel so, I also eventually write to [Please blog](http://please.noroutine.me). Just to not let you say that I didn't tell this - sometimes it's in Russian, sometimes in Ukrainian, sometimes in English, sometimes in Java, whichever language I felt was better - be careful.\r\n\r\nIn case you didn't find anything above worth your attention, I have a safety belt - my [Noname](http://lizard.noroutine.me:8000/Noname.FM.m3u) techno radio stream, where sometimes you can catch me making stupid comments on awesome techno/house tracks i mix. \r\n\r\nAnyway, you are somehow landed here and probably want to jump out somewhere else, so I just left my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oleksiykhilkevich) as a portal for you. \r\n\r\nIf you dare, you can also send me something at alex at noroutine dot me.","google":"UA-36916068-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
