        <p>Hi there,</p>

<p>My name is Alex, I live in Munich and mostly try to have fun, or I just imagine it... Overall my life goal is to conquer this planet and live the rest of my life in eternal joy and happiness. </p>

<p>I am both programmer and devops guy, mostly write in Go, Java, Groovy, JavaScript, but I can crack anything (I was doing Prolog guys - serious stuff). </p>

<p>I've made some nice tools, like <a href="http://dust4j.noroutine.me/">dust4j</a> and <a href="http://tobacco.noroutine.me/">Tobacco</a> - pretty useful stuff I think... </p>

<p>When I feel so, I also eventually write to <a href="http://please.noroutine.me">Please blog</a>. Just to not let you say that I didn't tell this - sometimes it's in Russian, sometimes in Ukrainian, sometimes in English, sometimes in Java, whichever language I felt was better - be careful.</p>

<p>In case you didn't find anything above worth your attention, I have a safety belt - my <a href="http://radio.noroutine.me">noroutine techno radio stream</a>, where sometimes you can catch me making stupid comments on awesome techno/house tracks i mix. </p>

<p>Anyway, you are somehow landed here and probably want to jump out somewhere else, so I just left my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oleksiykhilkevich">LinkedIn Profile</a> as a portal for you. Shoot your best offer!</p>

<p>If you dare, you can also send me something at alex at noroutine dot me.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
