Overall my life goal is to conquer this planet and live the rest of my life in eternal joy and happiness. \r\n\r\nI've made some nice tools, like [dust4j](http://dust4j.noroutine.me/) and [Tobacco](http://tobacco.noroutine.me/) - pretty useful stuff I think... \r\n\r\nWhen I feel so, I also eventually write to [Please blog](http://please.noroutine.me). Sometimes it's in Russian, sometimes in Ukrainian, sometimes in Java, sometimes in English,  whenever I feel so, so be careful.\r\n\r\nAnyway, you are somehow landed here and probably want to jump out somewhere else, so I just left my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oleksiykhilkevich) as a portal for you.","name":"Noroutine Pages","google":"UA-36916068-1","tagline":"my very own hq"}
