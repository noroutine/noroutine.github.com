Hi there,

My name is Alex, I live in Munich and mostly try to have fun, or I just imagine it... Overall my life goal is to conquer this planet and live the rest of my life in eternal joy and happiness. 

I am both programmer and devops guy, mostly write in Go, Java, Groovy, JavaScript, but I can crack anything (I was doing Prolog guys - serious stuff). 
 
I've made some nice tools, like [dust4j](http://dust4j.noroutine.me/) and [Tobacco](http://tobacco.noroutine.me/) - pretty useful stuff I think... 

[ffhash](http://noroutine.me/ffhash) might be of interest as well - a fast consistent hashing algorithm for DHT on a small cluster

When I feel so, I also eventually write to [Please blog](http://please.noroutine.me). Just to not let you say that I didn't tell this - sometimes it's in Russian, sometimes in Ukrainian, sometimes in English, sometimes in Java, whichever language I felt was better - be careful.

In case you didn't find anything above worth your attention, I have a safety belt - my [noroutine techno radio stream](http://radio.noroutine.me), where sometimes you can catch me making stupid comments on awesome techno/house tracks i mix. 

Anyway, you are somehow landed here and probably want to jump out somewhere else, so I just left my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oleksiykhilkevich) as a portal for you. Shoot your best offer!

If you dare, you can also send me something at alex at noroutine dot me.

Cheers
